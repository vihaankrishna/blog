# ARE YOU RECYCLING YOUR PLASTIC BOTTLES

The usage of plastic bottle containers for your drinking water or beverages has become the most economical and cost-efficient strategy in the drinking & package industry. After using it are we disposing of it in the recycle bins? If we are trashing it properly then we are contributing an important part of the product's life cycle and helping the environment as it can be recycled and reused for making something new product again. As almost 80% of the plastic bottles we trash can be recycled and reusable, most of us throw away the plastic at the wrong place maybe because we were unaware or no proper availability of recycle bin or unorganized waste/recycle management.

The recycled plastic is collected and cut into small flakes or pieces and stored and this is processed and used in making things like cups, carpet fibers, trays, clothing, new beverage bottles, etc. This is one of the best ways of saving energy and eco friendly, Every user of plastic should understand proper recycling management helps a lot in saving the earth. Everyone is busy with their lives and we forget proper disposal of plastic but if we make it a habit/social responsibility and put it into our daily life then it is worth it and matters a lot to the environment.organize waste management well, place recycle bins beside garbage and use proper place to drop plastic.
After using a water or beverage bottle cap it and recycle the bottle as every plastic is valuable.Purchase recycled plastic material to support ongoing recycled products
For regular drinking water or beverages, etc try avoiding plastic and use stainless steel or glass bottles.
